In this contribution we outline central algorithms for studying
quantum mechanical systems, with an emphasis on both computational and
pedagogical aspects. Using simple systems that allow for analytical
solutions, we show how one can move from linear algebra and eigenvalue
algorithms using for example full configuration interaction theory, to
stochastic methods like variational and Diffusion Monte Carlo
approaches and finally, how we can use Monte Carlo methods together
with deep learning algorithms. Along this journey we will present ten
central algorithms which have changed considerably the way we study
interacting many-particle systems.  These algorithms span from
Householderâ€™s famous transformation of matrices, via iterative
eigenvalue solvers to neural networks and automatic differentiation
for optimizing multidimensional functions. Codes and jupyter-notebooks
are provided, allowing thereby the reader to experiment and practice
the various methods.
